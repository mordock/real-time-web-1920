My unique feature is a profanity filter which censors swear words. This uses a defined array in the code and checks the chat comments against this list on the server.

# Exercise 2 - my unique app

## Description
My app will make use of the Real time API Binance:  
https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-official-api-docs  
This is an API which keeps track of crypto currency(CC) transactions. With this API I want to show the user which CC is, right now, the most profitable. I am considering to use D3 to show a graph of what is happening.  
In this app the user can change the API call by selecting which CC he wants to see.
